CONDITIONS:
STACK A IS FULL
STACK B IS EMPTY
STACK A HAS >3 INTEGERS


STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THE ALGORITHM:
1. PB TWICE (2 INTS TO STACK B)

2. FOR EACH INT IN STACK A CALCULATE COST TO MOVE TO STACK B
	2.1 FIND THE HIGHEST SMALLER NUMBER FOR EACH A[i] IN B
	2.2 PUSH B BASED ON LOWEST COST
	2.3 STOP WHEN STACK A HAS 3 INTS LEFT

3. ASCEND SORT STACK A

4. FOR EACH B[i], FIND CLOSEST HIGHEST INT IN STACK A
	4.1 MANIPULATE STACK A SO IT ALIGNS
	4.2 PUSH A

NOW STACK B IS EMPTY.

5. BASED ON THE INDEX OF HIGHEST INT IN STACK A, EITHER RA OR RRA.

6. THE STACK IS SORTED NOW.
